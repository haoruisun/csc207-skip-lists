# csc207-skip-lists

Haorui Sun

This is for Assignment 8: Skip lists.

Algorithm Analysis:
I initialized 1000 skiplists with length form 1 to 999 since the computer can not handle that much calculation. Then I took of 
the mean of "time" that skip-list used to search a random number in its range. Because of small sample size, the result was not very distinct, but we could still tell the O(lg n) type.
